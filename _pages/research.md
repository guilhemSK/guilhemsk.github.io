I am a computational ecologist broadly interested in ecology and evolution across ecosystems. In particular, I am interested in leveraging large molecular datasets to answer fundamental questions in microbial ecology. To achieve this, I strive to build probabilistic models of community assembly that are based on ecological mechanisms but amenable to efficient Bayesian inference, and apply them to a wide range of ecosystems, from the human gut to open ocean plankton.
