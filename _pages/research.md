I am a computational ecologist broadly interested in microbial ecology and evolution across ecosystems. In particular, I am interested in leveraging large molecular datasets to answer basic questions in microbial ecology: 

* How do community composition and structure relate to ecological niche and function? 
* What ecological processes determine local community composition? In particular, how large is the relative influence of dispersal and local environmental filtering?
* At what time scales are microbial communities stable? How and why do they shift between states?

However, microbial ecology currently lacks the necessary tools to provide a quantitative ecological interpretation of large molecular datasets. To remediate this, I aim at building probabilistic models of community assembly that are based on ecological mechanisms but amenable to efficient Bayesian inference. I strive to apply these models to a wide range of ecosystems, from the human gut to open ocean plankton, thus generating insights with broad societal implications from human health to the global carbon cycle.
